# LinkedIn Profile Analysis
This is my personal LinkedIn profile dashboard using Excel and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/song.cang.nguyen/viz/Linkedin_profile_Analysis/Dashboard2) The goal is to showcase my connections, interactions, the companies I follow, and analyze my connections over time. Here's the breakdown of the steps: 

  **1. Data Collection and Organization**: Gathering my personal data related to LinkedIn profile: connections, interactions (messages, endorsements, etc.), company I follow. I stored these data in **Excel** spreadsheet, which provides a structured format for managing and manipulating the data.

  **2. Data Cleaning and Preparation**:Before visualizing the data, I performed data cleaning and preparation tasks within **Excel**, including removing duplicates, standardizing formats, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency across the data.

  **3. Data Visualization with Tableau**: Once my data is cleaned and prepared, I utilized **Tableau** to create interactive and insightful visualization
